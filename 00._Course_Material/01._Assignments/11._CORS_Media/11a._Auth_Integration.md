# 11a [Individual/Pairs/Group] Auth Integration

Expose a frontend that allows users to log in / sign up. Use a service for federated identities that potentially provide SSO. 

**Type**: Individual/Pairs/Group

You are allowed to work in pairs or groups of three for this assignment if you find that easier.

**Hand-in**:

1. Git link for the code. 

2. Documentation that goes through step by step on how you set it up. The guide should be so detailed that anyone can follow it and reproduce the result. 


Hint: Many services for federated identities exist. Part of the assignment is to research them. It would be a good idea to create a document that lists pros and cons and considerations during the research phase.  

Hint 2: If you are spending many hours implenting things yourself then you have likely misunderstood the assignment. The goal is to integrate with an existing solution.
